# CosineSimilarity-.Net-AzureOpenAI-
This project demonstrates how to calculate semantic similarity between two pieces of text using Azure OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model. Built as a C# .NET 8 console application, it leverages the Embeddings API via raw HTTP calls to generate high-dimensional vector representations of input texts and computes their cosine similarity.
